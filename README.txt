wylas-timing-meet-management-interface
======================================

This project describes a web service interface by which Wylas Timing 
(a wireless timing system for swimming, athletics and other sporting events)
communicates to a Meet Manager application.

A Meet Manager can enable the integration by implementing this interface at a web service end point.
Wylas Timing can then be configured to communicate with the end point and hence with the Meet Manager.

There exist implementations for a number of Meet Managers. 
Ask your Meet Manager vendor if they do, and if not why not?
